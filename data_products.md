## Sea-Ice Floe Segmentation Products

Sea-ice floe segmentation products are derived from high-resolution optical images acquired from the United States Geological Survey Global Fiducials Library (https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/global-fiducials-library). The products contain individually identified sea-ice floes and can be used easily to retrieve floe properties of interest, such as floe area (which is provided with the products already). For a full description of the products, see Denton and Timmermans (2021, [preprint](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2021-368)). The products are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6341620.

A preview of the products is provided below.
