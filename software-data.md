## Data Products

### Sea-Ice Floe Segmentation Products

These products are derived from high-resolution optical images acquired over the Arctic Canada Basin and disseminated by the United States Geological Survey Global Fiducials Library [(https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/global-fiducials-library)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/global-fiducials-library). They contain individually identified sea-ice floes; various floe properties may easily be retrieved from them, including floe number, area, diameter, and shape (area is provided with the products already). For a full description of the products, see Denton and Timmermans (2021, [preprint](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2021-368)). The products are available at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6341620](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6341620).

A preview of the products is provided below.

### Library of sea ice floe remote sensing observations in the Beaufort Sea Marginal Ice Zone

These products contain a collection of geometrical and kinematic sea ice floe measurements for the analysis in the paper, "Spinning sea ice floes reveal emerging mesoscale turbulence in the Arctic Ocean" (accpeted to PNAS). These observations were retrieved from processed MODIS imagery using our Ice Floe Tracking algorithm. For a full description of the products, see " "Ice Floe Tracker: An algorithm to automatically retrieve Lagrangian trajectories via feature matching from moderate-resolution visual imagery" [(Lopez-Acosta et al., 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425719304250). The products are available at [https://zenodo.org/record/4796845#.Ykxp0ujMIuV](https://zenodo.org/record/4796845#.Ykxp0ujMIuV)
